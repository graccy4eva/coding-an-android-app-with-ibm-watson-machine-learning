# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [Coding an Android App With IBM Watson Machine Learning][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]



In early 2011, a natural language understanding computer system called IBM Watson was able to beat all human contestants in a quiz-like game show called Jeopardy!. It was an historic event and was perhaps the point when the general public started to realize that artificial intelligence was no longer the stuff of science fiction.

Back then, Watson ran on a supercomputer and could do little more than answer trivia questions. Today, however, it has been transformed into a far more versatile system, and a lot of its capabilities are available over the cloud.

In this series of tutorials, I'll show you how to use various services offered by the IBM Watson Developer Cloud in Android apps. In this introductory tutorial, you'll learn how to work with IBM Bluemix, the Watson Java SDK, and the Watson tone analyzer service to create a simple Android app that can identify the emotions present in any piece of written text.
